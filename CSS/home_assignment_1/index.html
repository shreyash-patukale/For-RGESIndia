        <p class="poem">
            I met a traveller from an antique land,<br />
            Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br />
            Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br />
            Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br />
            And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br />
            Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br />
            Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br />
            The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br />
            And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br />
            My name is <span class="ozy">Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings;<br />
            Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br />
            Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br />
            Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br />
            The lone and level sands stretch far away.”<br />
        </p>
