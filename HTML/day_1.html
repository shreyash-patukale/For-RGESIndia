    <h1>Shreyash Patukale</h1>
    <p>Hello! I am a computer science student passionate about AI, machine learning, and data science. I am currently working on an automated aeroponics system that integrates real-time monitoring and machine learning to optimize plant growth.</p>
    
    <h2>My Aeroponics Project</h2>
    <p>My aeroponics project is focused on using sensors to collect data such as pH, TDS, temperature, and humidity to manage plant nutrition precisely. I use an ESP32 microcontroller to process real-time data and a Random Forest Regression model to predict and adjust nutrient levels.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time sensor data collection</li>
        <li>Automated pH and nutrient adjustments</li>
        <li>Machine learning for predictive analysis</li>
        <li>Edge computing with <b><i><u><h>ESP32</h></u></i></b> for efficient processing</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Future Goals</h2>
    <p><mark>I aim to refine my model further and expand its capabilities to create a fully automated, AI-driven aeroponics system that enhances crop yield and efficiency.</mark></p>
